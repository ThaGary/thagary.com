			<p>My name is Gary! I'm currently a Social Media Risk Analyst but I'm currently learning code so that I can attend <a href="https://www.galvanize.com/denver-platte/web-development">Galvanize's web development program</a>. I am a USN Veteran, I was honorably discharged as EM2(SW). I spend my free time on Twitch doing Community/Event Moderation. I am verified TwitchBot and I have a few scripts running in many chats across the platform with the help of my good friend <a href="https://twitter.com/Technoblazed">Techno</a>. My goal is to work full time for a company as a member of their web team.</p>
			<center><h2><u>Experiences</u></h2></center>
			<p>I am a quick learner of technical things. I think that is one reason I wanted to be an electrician in the USN. I have always been intrigued with code ever since I customized my Myspace page for the first time. I recently got a lot more involved with programing when I became a lead moderator for many channels on <a href="https://twitch.tv">Twitch</a>. I learned how to get my script to connect with Twitch's chat client so that my account would automatically send thank you messages to new channel subscribers and donators for broadcasters. I had some help from my friend to set up my server when I bought it a year ago, now I'm experienced enough to make changes to my server and recertify it all on my own.</p>
			<center><h2><u>This Page</u></h2></center>
			<p>Reason for this page is so that I can submit it to Galvanize for my admission portfolio. This page I typed out all by myself with the knowledge that I already know and with a little help from google. After my interview at Galvanize, I was informed about <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/">freecodecamp</a> so I decided to go through some of the curriculum before submitting my portfolio. I wrote this page in a program called sublime that I have been using for a year. After I wrote the code I uploaded it to my server via WinSCP. Most of my knowledge is from surfing the internet and watching tutorials currently.</p>
